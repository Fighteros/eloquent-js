# Introdcution

-  Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming.
- The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity.
- A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules.
- JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows.
-  The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in
JavaScript easier for beginners
- In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems
in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you
